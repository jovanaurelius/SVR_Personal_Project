This project was conducted based on the fluctuations in the price of rupiah (IDR) during 2016-2021. During that time, the United States and China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic caused a substantial rupiah price change. In this project, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to predict the closing price of United States dollar (USD) towards IDR for January 2022. The data used to build the model is daily closing price of USD towards IDR from 2016-2021. Based on similar research, SVR performs well since the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used in its computation.
